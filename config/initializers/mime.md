    | A list of Mime types the server will allow 
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | MIME types describe the media type of content that is being sent to the server. 
    | They are intended to help provide a hint as to how the content should be processed and displayed.
    | If a web server or application reports an incorrect MIME type for content (including a "default type" for unknown content), a  
    | web browser has no way of knowing the author's intentions.
    | This may cause unexpected behavior.
