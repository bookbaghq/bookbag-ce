  Summary of AI Image Handling Implementation

  I've successfully implemented a complete end-to-end system for detecting, downloading,
  storing, and displaying AI-generated images from LLMs. Here's what was done:

  1. Response Normalization Service ✅

  File: /components/chats/app/service/responseNormalizationService.js (Created)

  - Created vendor-specific adapters for:
    - OpenAI: Handles native content[] format
    - Anthropic/Claude: Extracts images from Markdown (![alt](url))
    - Grok/xAI: Extracts images from Markdown and plain text
    - Mistral: Extracts images from Markdown
    - Gemini: Handles Google's JSON/text format
    - Generic: Fallback for unknown vendors
  - Each adapter normalizes responses into a unified format:
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: [
      { type: "text", text: "...", meta: { source, vendor, model } },
      { type: "image_url", image_url: "https://...", meta: { source, vendor, model } }
    ]
  }

  2. Media Service Enhancement ✅

  File: /components/media/app/service/mediaService.js (Modified)

  Added three new methods:
  - downloadImageFromUrl(url) - Downloads images from temporary CDN URLs
  - saveAIGeneratedImage(imageUrl, options) - Downloads, saves to disk, creates MediaFile
   record
  - saveBase64Image(base64Data, options) - Handles base64-encoded images
  - getExtensionFromUrl(url) - Extracts file extension from URLs

  Images are saved to bb-storage/media/ with format: ai-{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}

  3. Backend Streaming Integration ✅

  File: /app/sockets/chatSocket.js (Modified)

  Added AI image processing after LLM response generation (lines 527-599):
  - Normalizes LLM response using ResponseNormalizationService
  - Detects images using hasImages() and getImageUrls()
  - Downloads and saves each image via MediaService
  - Sends aiImage events to frontend for real-time display
  - Updates assistant message with image attachments
  - Cleans text content (removes image URLs/markdown)

  4. Message Persistence ✅

  File: /components/chats/app/service/messagePersistenceService.js (Modified)

  Added updateMessageAttachments(messageId, imageUrls) method (lines 469-510):
  - Updates message attachments in database
  - Merges with existing attachments
  - Handles JSON serialization

  5. Frontend Event Handling ✅

  File: /nextjs-app/app/bb-client/_components/controllers/ChatController.js (Modified)

  Added aiImage event handler (lines 501-527):
  - Listens for aiImage events from backend
  - Adds image URLs to assistant message attachments
  - Updates React state for immediate display

  6. UI Display Component ✅

  File: /nextjs-app/app/bb-client/_components/components/ChatMessageItem.js (Modified)

  Added AI image display for assistant messages (lines 150-162):
  - Displays AI-generated images below assistant message text
  - Uses same styling as user-uploaded images
  - Positioned between message content and stats pills

  Architecture Highlights

  1. Vendor-Agnostic: System works with any LLM vendor through adapter pattern
  2. Real-Time: Images appear as they're processed during streaming
  3. Persistent: Images saved to disk and linked in database
  4. Unified Format: All responses normalized to OpenAI schema internally
  5. Clean Text: Image URLs/markdown removed from displayed text
  6. Metadata Tracking: Stores original URL, vendor, source for each image

  The implementation follows the user's architectural guidance to "adopt OpenAI's
  content[] schema as the internal standard" and build adapters for all other vendors,
  creating a vendor-agnostic image handling system.
