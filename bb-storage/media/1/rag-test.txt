# The History of the Solar Lamp

Solar lamps are devices that convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells. 
They store energy in rechargeable batteries and use it to power light sources at night.
The first commercially available solar lamp was introduced in 1990 by Philips in Kenya.

## Advantages of Solar Lamps
1. They reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
2. They are cost-effective in the long term.

4. They are environmentally friendly and emit no greenhouse gases.

## Fun Facts
- Solar lamps are often used in rural electrification projects in Africa and Asia.
- A typical solar lamp battery lasts about 5 years.
- Modern solar lamps often use LED bulbs because they are more energy-efficient.

## Famous Projects
One of the largest solar lighting projects was the "Lighting Africa" initiative, launched by the World Bank and IFC. 
It aimed to bring clean, affordable lighting to over 250 million people by 2030.
